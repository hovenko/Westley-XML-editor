Westley version 0.01
====================

This module alters a Westley XML project from using small video stub files
to use the original video files.

It creates a workdir of choice, to store all altered project files in.

It rewrites the path of the video files.
It must know the path pattern to the smaller video (proxy) files
and the path pattern to the original video files.

For projects that use Westley XML files, new Westley XML files are created
that point to the original video files. These will be created in the workdir.
This works recursively for all resources of the project, such as titles,
still images, etc.

The new project Westley XML file is finally written
to a file of choice.

WHERE TO START

Kdenlive is a video editor for Linux that integrates nicely with KDE.
This application stores its projects in Westley XML.

For this library and scripts to be useful you would be using proxy files
instead of your original video files.

A reason to use proxy video files is when the original files are
stored inside a heavy codec, such as h264, and in high resolution.
Such files are hard to work with on most computers.


TROUBLESHOOTING

If the proxy file and original file is not of the same length
(ie. the same amount of frames), you might see some transition effects
and cuts to be out of sync with what you was seeing in your editor.

I recommend you open up the altered project file after using this utility to
check the transition points once more before rendering the final video.
